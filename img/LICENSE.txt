The Robosane branding is obviously not open-source as the rest of the project.

The Robosane logo rights reserved, obviously by Robosane.

The cmc1 to 3 images contain content that is owned by Mojang, from their game Minecraft.
 We include these purely so you can test how the template looks without having to find more backgrounds.
 We do not claim that these are our own, and neither should you.

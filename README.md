# Robosane's Joomla Website Template
Robosane's Top-Secret new Website Appearance,  
But it's not so secret anymore.  

I use this template primarily at https://robosane.net/

Features:
 * Twitter Cards support!
   * Uses article title and text when available
 * Mobile native experience
 * Desktop/touchscreen all resolution support
 * Bootstrap based, open code base
 * Designed with help from Chrome Dev Tools
 * Works in most browsers (over 96% of users with perfect support, http://caniuse.com/ )

Before making this your default template for a site, edit the template settings, as without configuration you'll be missing most of the point to this template.

All bootstrap override CSS is mainly in `css/robosane.css`.  
If needed, the template includes it's own versions of bootstrap and jQuery that are known to work, simply switch the includes in index.php if the Joomla ones don't work.

TLDR Legal things:
---
(Mozilla License)
 * This project includes Robosane branding and imagery. If you wish to use this NOT on behalf of Robosane, you must remove this branding from the template.
 * You are free to use this template in a personal and commercial setting, and you may make any modifications you see fit. If you distribute this template, you are required to include the source code. (Which should be easy considering it is all web-content.)
 * Although not explicitly required, if you could give me some credit when using this template, it would be much appreciated!

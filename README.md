# Robosane's Joomla Website Template
Robosane's Top-Secret new Website Appearance,  
But it's not so secret anymore.  

Features:
 * Correct Twitter cards for Article Pages
 * Mobile native experience
 * Desktop all resolution support
 * Bootstrap based, modern coding standards.
 * Best experienced in Chrome, all platforms

Before using this, be sure to TEST IT and ask me. I have only ever tested this template on https://robosane.net/

All bootstrap override CSS is mainly in css/robosane.css
If needed, the template includes it's own versions of bootstrap and jQuery that are known to work, simply switch the includes in index.php if needed.

TLDR Legal things:
---
(Mozilla License)
 * This project includes Robosane branding and imagery. If you wish to use this NOT on behalf of Robosane, you must remove this branding from the template.
 * You are free to use this template in a personal and commercial setting, and you may make any modifications you see fit. If you distribute this template, you are required to include the source code. (Which should be easy considering it is all web-content.)
 * Although not explicitly required, if you could give me some credit when using this template, it would be much appreciated!
